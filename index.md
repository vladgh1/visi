## [Description](#)
Visi is a smart assistant for people with special needs. It includes auditive, visual and kinetic modifications of a web page.

## [Interface](#)
The assistant can be found in the bottom right corner of the page as a droplet. When clicking on it, a menu pop-up will appear, from where you can select the desired condition.

The conditions are separated as follows: auditive, visual and kinetic. The text is also accompanied by respective icons.

The text has a large font size as well as readable font, making sure even people with poor vision would be able to read it.

The colors are plain and simple, and the most importantly, contrast.

All the clickable interactions will be accompanied by a beeping sound of a different tone and pitch, followed by a voice reading the text under the pointer, making sure the people with vision problems could use it without any problems.
